# Redemption for Data Generated as an Undergraduate Assistant

##Introduction
In the spring of 2020, I was working as an undergaduate research assistant at the University of Iowa High Throughput Screening  facility, where I was generating data on cellular responses to several possible drug candidates for ovarian cancer. Everything with that went perfect until the portion of my 'final project' for them where I had to generate figures (long story short I bombed it due to my inexpierience generating actual scientific figures and working with data at that level). Now that I am more experienced and  have been able to learn more, this is the perfect opportunity for me to prove to myself I know how to do this sort of thing. The data I will be working with is generated based on the mean of the standard deviations of the fluorescence of the nuclei of the cells over a period of 24 hours (per well)

To See the Figures, see Pictures 1 and 2 in this directory (github is unhappy with embedding photos at the moment)
Here they are embedded just in case it suddenly works:
